I just wanted to add splash screens to the game.

## Issues

Multiple issues were discovered while trying to remedy the issue that only *.bmp-files could be selected from the front-end in the editor.
* Selecting a splash image through the Editor only allows you to select *.bmp-files. This isn't consistent behaviour as when the editor or game starts up it will look in the Content/Splash folder for the specific filenames and loop over an array of image file extenstions.
* Splash image is copied with a *.BMP-file extension, regardless of the original extension.
* Default engine splash images are displayed in the editor front-end, even though custom ones have been defined in the project (which are being used at startup).

Optional:
* Splash image names are hard coded and can't be changed.

## Proposed solutions

### BMP only file selection

Change the SExternalImagePicker to accept an array of file extensions. This did require some rewriting of other pieces of code that pass data through to this class;
* class SExternalImageReference
* struct FExternalImagePickerConfiguration

SExternalImageReference is the top-most exposed Slate element that we need to add the file extensions to. This class create a FExternalImagePickerConfiguration that gets pass through to FExternalImagePickerModule, which create the SExternalImagePicker.

Created a static array for the supported splash file extensions in FGenericPlatformSplash.

### Image copied with BMP extension

Before the copy is called, we chop off the old file extension and append the new one.

Before:
```
if(!SourceControlHelpers::CopyFileUnderSourceControl(InTargetImage, InChosenImage, LOCTEXT("ImageDescription", "image"), FailReason))
```

After:
```
const FString NewTargetImage = InTargetImage.LeftChop(4).Append(InChosenImage.Right(4));

FText FailReason;
if(!SourceControlHelpers::CopyFileUnderSourceControl(NewTargetImage, InChosenImage, LOCTEXT("ImageDescription", "image"), FailReason))
```

Thanks!
